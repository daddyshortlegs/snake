# Snake

## Intro

It's a time of great peril! Rats, curiously square shaped, are trying to take over
the world! Only one hero can save the day, Snake!

Fortunately, Snake likes rats. Unfortunately, he grows as he munches on them. As
Snake moves his curiously rectangular body around the curiously rectangular world,
if he crashes into himself, it's game over. Rats!
